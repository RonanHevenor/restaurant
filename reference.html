        				<p class="to-design-this">To design this website we began by brainstorming. We made a list of general things a restaurant website would need such as hours, a menu, and an about page.</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">&nbsp;</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">We then talked with one of our teachers who is vegan to get her input on what a person on a vegan diet looks for when eating out. When talking with her we learned that it is important the food its tasty and sustainability sourced.</p>

      			<div class="body001">
        				<p class="to-design-this">Once we had some idea of the values placed in vegan foods we created a mind map to brainstorm branding ideas.</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">&nbsp;</p>
        				<p class="while-working-on">While working on the mind map we came up with  the idea to make the restaurant a international cafe. By having the restaurant be a small cafe, we could have all ingredients sourced locally.</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">&nbsp;</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">As we continued with the mind map, we decided a common edible plant would be ideal for our logo, giving us the dandelion branding.</p>

        				<p class="to-design-this">The standard vegan restaurant goes one of two ways: sleek and modern or green. However, we wanted to break out of this trend. </p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">&nbsp;</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">We chose to go with a soft yellow, incorporating the yellow of the dandelion flower. Additionally, yellow is associated with joy, optimism, and energy, all things we wanted to express through this cafe.</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">&nbsp;</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">For our secondary colors we choose a white with pink undertones and a black with green undertones. By avoiding pure black and white, we made the website more visually appealing and softer on the eyes.</p>

        				<p class="to-design-this">Our entire website was designed in Figma. We used Microsoft Visual Studio Code to develop our site.</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">&nbsp;</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">From VS Code we edited the Figma deign to be responsive. We use Github for source control, and host with GitHub pages.</p>

      			<div class="body001">
        				<p class="to-design-this">We wanted our restaurant to not only source local, but explain why. By adding an about page that delves into the environmental impact of food sourcing as well as the challenges and benefits of a vegan diet, we were able to better explain our choices.</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">&nbsp;</p>
        				<p class="to-design-this">For the design of the website we looked at different restaurant sites linked in a toast article titled, “The 12 Best Restaurant Website Examples”.</p>
